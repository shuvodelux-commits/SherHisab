/**
 * StockLots.gs
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Lot/Batch inventory layer sitting underneath Products.Current Stock.
 * Every purchase line creates its own Stock Lot (own Purchase Price, own
 * Remaining Quantity); sales/adjustments/returns consume or restore
 * specific lots via the helpers below instead of ever touching a single
 * pooled number. Products.Current Stock stays a fast-read cache exactly
 * like before — every caller of these helpers is still responsible for
 * updating it, so every existing screen that reads Current Stock keeps
 * working unchanged (POS grid, Dashboard, low-stock, etc).
 *
 * Review item 10: the client-reachable functions here now require a
 * session token. Apps Script exposes every global function without a
 * trailing underscore to google.script.run, so an ungated one is
 * reachable by anyone holding the web app URL.
 *
 * getProductLots exposed per-lot purchase prices - your cost basis - to
 * anyone with the URL. It now checks 'products':'view'.
 *
 * Review item 12 / P0 #8: consumeStockFIFO_ used to decide AND write in
 * one pass, which made "validate everything before writing anything"
 * impossible for its callers — by the time you knew line 3 was short,
 * lines 1 and 2 had already been drawn down. It is now split into
 * planStockConsumption_ (decides, writes nothing) and
 * applyStockConsumption_ (writes a plan). consumeStockFIFO_ remains as a
 * plan-then-apply wrapper with its original signature and return shape,
 * so Products.adjustStock and SalesManagement.updateSale are untouched.
 *
 * Review item 11 / P0 #7: FIFO consumed lots in 'Created At' order —
 * when the row was WRITTEN. Purchase.gs also stamped the lot's Purchase
 * Date with now() rather than the purchase's own date. So a purchase
 * backdated to last month became the NEWEST lot and FIFO consumed it
 * last, which quietly corrupts cost of goods sold and inventory
 * valuation. Both now use the real purchase date, with Lot ID as a
 * stable tiebreak for lots bought the same day (IDs are zero-padded, so
 * string order is creation order).
 *
 * P3 drift (items 8 & 10): getProductLots() now returns an explicit
 * shape instead of raw sheet rows (which leaked the internal _rowIndex
 * to the browser — every other read endpoint in the app maps its
 * output). consumeStockFIFO_'s LEGACY back-fill no longer re-finds a
 * row it just wrote: createLot_ delegates to createLotWithRow_, which
 * hands back the row index appendRow_ already returned.
