/**
 * Config.gs
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Single source of truth for sheet names, column headers, ID prefixes
 * and default settings. Change a sheet name or add a column HERE only —
 * every other file reads through this object, so nothing else needs to
 * change when the shape of the data changes.
 *
 * MERGED FINAL VERSION. Two separate rounds of schema work are folded
 * into this one file:
 *   1. Backdate columns on seven transaction sheets (below).
 *   2. Bank Ledger audit columns on BANK_BOOK (further down).
 * Both are purely additive. Nothing is renamed or removed, so no existing
 * data or code can break. RUN SETUP / REPAIR SYSTEM AFTER PASTING.
 *
 * Backdate columns (prerequisite for the P3 item 6 refactor): eight
 * modules have been writing 'Is Backdated' / 'Backdated Days' /
 * 'Backdated Reason' since the Tier 1 backdate work, and DayBook.gs has
 * been reading them back — but they were never declared here, so
 * appendRow_ silently dropped them on every write and Day Book always
 * read undefined. They are appended to the end of the seven affected
 * HEADERS arrays below; CUSTOMER_LEDGER and SUPPLIER_LEDGER also gain
 * the 'Created At' column their payment writers have been sending.
 *
 * All additive — getSheetHeaders_ self-healing appends the new columns
 * at the end of each sheet on first touch, and existing rows just get
 * blanks. RUN SETUP / REPAIR SYSTEM AFTER PASTING THIS FILE.
