/**
 * CashBook.gs
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every action that moves physical cash — a cash/partial sale, a
 * purchase payment, a customer payment, an expense, opening or closing
 * a cash session — writes through addCashBookEntry_() so there is
 * exactly one running Balance, computed the same way every time.
 *
 * Review item 6 / P0 #4: addCashBookEntry_ hardcoded 'Date': new Date(),
 * so a sale or expense dated last week posted its CASH side to TODAY.
 * That inflated today's open drawer (getCashSessionSummary counts every
 * Cash Book row since the session opened) and mis-placed the entry in
 * Day Book's running cash balance. It now takes an optional Date, and
 * the create paths pass their own transaction date through. Mirrors the
 * same change already made to addBankBookEntry_.
 *
 * Optional means optional: any caller that passes no Date still gets
 * now(), so nothing that wasn't updated changes behaviour.
 *
 * Note on the Balance column: it is a running total in POSTING order,
 * not date order. Once entries can be backdated those differ. The final
 * figure stays correct either way — each row is previous + delta, so the
 * last row reflects the balance when it was posted. Later soft-deletes
 * can invalidate stored balances, so getCashBalance_ sums live movements.
 * The intermediate per-row Balance values are non-chronological. Day Book already sorts by timestamp before
 * walking them, and the Cash & Bank report recomputes from opening.
